# This script is typically run (as root user) either like:
# - from restic service/timer: $PREFIX/etc/systemd/system/restic-backup.{service,timer}
# - from a cronjob: $PREFIX/etc/cron.d/restic
# - manually by a user. For it to work, the environment variables must be set in the shell where this script is executed
#   $ source $PREFIX/etc/default.env

# Exit on error, unset var, pipe failure
set -euo pipefail

# Clean up lock if we are killed.
# If killed by systemd, like $(systemctl stop restic), then it kills the whole cgroup and all it's subprocesses.
# However if we kill this script ourselves, we need this trap that kills all subprocesses manually.

## Self-contained backup files per backup path. E.g. having an USB disk at /mnt/media in BACKUP_PATHS,
# a file /mnt/media/.backup_exclude will automatically be detected and used:
for backup_path in ${BACKUP_PATHS[@]}; do
	if [ -f "$backup_path/.backup_exclude" ]; then
		exclusion_args+=" --exclude-file $backup_path/.backup_exclude"
	fi

# NOTE start all commands in background and wait for them to finish.
# Reason: bash ignores any signals while child process is executing and thus the trap exit hook is not triggered.
# However if put in subprocesses, wait(1) waits until the process finishes OR signal is received.
