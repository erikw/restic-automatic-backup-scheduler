# This is the default profile. Fill it with your desired configuration.
# Additionally, you can create and use more profiles by copying this file.

# This file (and other .env.sh files) has two purposes:
# - being sourced by systemd timers to setup the backup before running restic_backup.sh
# - being sourced in a user's shell to work directly with restic commands e.g.
#  $ source /etc/restic/default.env.sh
#  $ restic snapshots
#  Thus you don't have to provide all the arguments like
#  $ restic --repo ... --password-file ...

# shellcheck source=etc/restic/_global.env.sh
. "$INSTALL_PREFIX/etc/restic/_global.env.sh"

# Envvars below will override those in _global.env.sh if present.

export RESTIC_REPOSITORY="b2:<b2-repo-name>"   # *EDIT* fill with your repo name

# What to backup. Colon-separated paths e.g. to different mountpoints "/home:/mnt/usb_disk".
# To backup only your home directory, set "/home/your-user"
export RESTIC_BACKUP_PATHS=""  # *EDIT* fill conveniently with one or multiple paths


# Example below of how to dynamically add a path that is mounted e.g. external USB disk.
# restic does not fail if a specified path is not mounted, but it's nicer to only add if they are available.
#test -d /mnt/media && RESTIC_BACKUP_PATHS+=" /mnt/media"

# A tag to identify backup snapshots.
export RESTIC_BACKUP_TAG=systemd.timer
